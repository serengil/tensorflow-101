# TensorFlow 101 Online Course Curriculum

The following curriculum includes the source codes and notebooks captured in **[TensorFlow 101: Introduction to Deep Learning](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-101-introduction-to-deep-learning/?referralCode=962F191091EC539DA5DA)** online course published on Udemy.

## Section 1 - Installing TensorFlow

1- **Hello, TensorFlow! Building Deep Neural Networks Classifier Model** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/DNNClassifier.py)

## Section 2 - Reusability in TensorFlow

1- **Restoring and Working on Already Trained DNN In TensorFlow** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/DNNClassifier.py)

The costly operation in neural networks is learning. You may spent hours to train a neural networks model. On the other hand, you can run the model in seconds after training. We'll mention how to store trained models and restore them.

2- **Importing Saved TensorFlow DNN Classifier Model in Java** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/java/TensorFlowDNNClassifier.java)

You can handle training with TensorFlow in Python and you can call this trained model from Java on your production pipeline.

## Section 3 - Monitoring and Evaluating

1- **Monitoring Model Evaluation Metrics in TensorFlow and TensorBoard** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/DNNClassifier.py)

## Section 4 - Building regression and time series models

1- **Building a DNN Regressor for Non-Linear Time Series in TensorFlow** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/DNNRegressor.py)

2- **Visualizing ML Results with Matplotlib and Embed them in TensorBoard** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/DNNRegressor.py)

## Section 5 - Building Unsupervised Learning Models

1- **Unsupervised learning and k-means clustering with TensorFlow** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/KMeansClustering.py)

We feel strong at supervised learning but today the more data we have is unlabeled. Unsupervised learning is mandatory field in machine learning.

2- **Applying k-means clustering to n-dimensional datasets in TensorFlow** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/KMeansClustering.py)

We can visualize clustering result on 2 and 3 dimensional space but the algorithm still works for higher dimensions even though we cannot visualize. Here, we apply k-means for n-dimensional data set but visualize for 3 dimensions.

## Section 6 - Tuning Deep Neural Networks Models

1- **Optimization Algorithms in TensorFlow** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/OptimizationAlgorithms.py)

2- **Activation Functions in TensorFlow** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/ActivationFunctions.py)

## Section 7 - Consuming TensorFlow via Keras

1- **Building DNN Classifier with Keras** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/HelloKeras.py)

2- **Storing and restoring a trained neural networks model with Keras** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/KerasModelRestoration.py)

# Section 8 - Advanced Applications

1- **Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Neural Networks** [`Code`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/HandwrittenDigitRecognitionUsingCNNWithKeras.py), [`Tutorial`](https://github.com/serengil/tensorflow-101/blob/master/python/HandwrittenDigitsClassification.py)
